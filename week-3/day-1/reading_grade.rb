    Playing games has always been thought to be important to
   the development of well-balanced and creative children
   however, what part, if any, they should play in the lives
   of adults has never been researched that deeply. I believe
   that playing games is every bit as important for adults
   as for children. Not only is taking time out to play games
   with our children and other adults valuable to building
   interpersonal relationships but is also a wonderful way
   to release built up tension.
